# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN: Achieving 98% Accuracy with TensorFlow😎🔐

## Experience the power of deep learning with our Kaggle repository! We present a comprehensive implementation of a brain tumor detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow. Achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%, our code showcases the following steps:🔥🧠

### 1. Importing Essential Libraries: ✅
Start by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model construction with TensorFlow.

### 2. Setting Up Dataset Paths and Directories: ✅
Define the dataset path and training/testing directories, and establish the categories for brain tumor types.

### 3. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset: ✅
Read images from each category in the training directory, create a DataFrame to store image data, and visualize the distribution of tumor types.

### 4. Visualizing Images for Each Tumor Type: ✅
Display sample images for each tumor type in a grid of subplots.

### 5. Setting Image Size, Batch Size, and Epochs: ✅
Define image dimensions, batch size for training, and the number of training epochs.

### 6. Building the Model Architecture: ✅
Construct a CNN model with convolutional, max pooling, dense, and dropout layers. Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

### 7. Training and Validation: ✅
Train the model using the training generator, tracking accuracy and loss over epochs. Validate on the test generator as well.

### 8. Visualization Through Graphs: ✅
Plot training and validation accuracy/loss curves over epochs to monitor the model's learning progress.

### 9. Evaluation: ✅
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset, calculating test loss and accuracy.
